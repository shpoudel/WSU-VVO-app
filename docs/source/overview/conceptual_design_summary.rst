Leveraging the GridAPPS-D Platform
-------------------------

The realization of an autonomous restoration application requires a measurement and control environment that provides post-fault situational awareness and the ability to remotely deploy the decisions for restoration.
GridAPPS-D is an open-source, standards-based platform designed to support the development of advanced, data-driven distribution system operation and/or planning applications that take advantage of the data-rich environment expected in modernized electric power distribution systems with smart grid technologies. 

Figure 2 shows a schematic for the interaction and communication among the distribution system operational sub-system for the proposed restoration application. The platform is typically integrated with other related data and decision-support systems/subsystems such as DERMS, SCADA, OMS, GIS, AMI, CIS to: a) monitor the distribution system conditions, b) obtain the DER availability and operating conditions, and c) for load estimation and control.
