Application Architecture 
------------

The proposed volt-var optimization application can be implemented in an advanced distribution management system (ADMS) as shown in Figure 1. Figure shows the overall architecture of a modern DMS with integration of several subsystems such as customer information system (CIS), geographical information system (GIS),  advanced metering infrastructure (AMI), SCADA and flowchart of the proposed DSR framework..
