Overview
========

Conservation voltage reduction (CVR) uses Volt-VAR optimization (VVO) methods to reduce customer power demand by controlling feeder's voltage control devices. The objective of this work is to present a VVO approach that controls system's legacy voltage control devices and coordinates their operation with smart inverter control.The volt-var optimization (VVO) is one of the most critical applications currently being adopted by the majority of distribution companies and made available by most ADMS vendors to manage system outages [CIT1]_.

This report documents the volt-var optimization application developed by Washington State University (WSU) and demonstrate its functionality by integrating it with a standards-based open-source platform -- `GridAPPS-D <https://gridappsd.readthedocs.io/en/master/>`_, developed by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL).
