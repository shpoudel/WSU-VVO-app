Overview
========

The electric power distribution system is facing a magnitude of challenges due to an increase in severe weather events leading to widespread network outages, coupled with the growing regulatory requirements for increased reliability and resilience, reduced carbon emissions, and growing distributed energy resources (DER) penetrations. The Fault Location Isolation and Service Restoration (FLISR) is one of the most critical applications currently being adopted by the majority of distribution companies and made available by most ADMS vendors to manage system outages [CIT1]_.

This report documents the restoration application developed by Washington State University (WSU) and demonstrate its functionality by integrating it with a standards-based open-source platform -- `GridAPPS-D <https://gridappsd.readthedocs.io/en/master/>`_, developed by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL).
